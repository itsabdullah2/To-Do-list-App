## Creating a to-do list app
#### First, what are the parts of the project:

- home page
- all-day page
- tomorrow page
- next 7 days page
- inbox page
- timer page
Secondly, the features of each page:

home page:
- You can add normal tasks to it via the button above called "add task", and next to this button is another button you can show and hide the calendar, and there is an input at the beginning of the page that helps you add a title to the page, and the page also contains a clock. You can hide it or show it as you like.
- Also, you can add your name to the home page through input in the side nav

Tomorrow page:
- A page that helps you add the tasks for the next day.

Next 7 days:
- A page that helps you add the tasks for the next 7 days.

All days:
- This page contains all the tasks for the home page, tomorrow page, and next 7 days page.

Inbox page:
- The difference about this page is that the tasks on it are not added to the all-days page This is a separate page.

Timer page:
- The idea of this page is like a Pomodoro and its advantages are that you can add many Pomodoros and you can modify it on work and break time

Features of this project:
- You can modify the task after it is added to the page.
- The project is responsive and can be used on any device.
- A plan is available to set your tasks, whether the task remains for today, tomorrow, or 7 days.


- You can use the project to figure out more feature

The technology that I used:
